x	rex insertion scheme is probably fragile (mod reg vs mod r/m depends on instruction)
-	REP; RET (!) to avoid bad branch prediction in amd64
x	MOVSLQ...
-	CMOV..
	x	6.out.h and 6a
	x	6l
	-	6c?
x	MOV to CR8 requires REX prefix
x	check INCL/DECL
~	libmach disassembly

-	CBW/CWDE/CDQE as special case of MOVBWSX AL,AX etc? (0x98)
-	three-operand IMUL
x	vector ops in 6.out.h and 6a/6l
x	REGARG (use BP not DI)
-	mul/div?
	- mul should be ok but needs testing
	- div by mul needs extension
no	vlong as 128 bits?
x	extern register
x	more registers
x	XMM ops for FP
-	128 bit ops?
-	libc
	x	initial amd64
	-	memmove etc (must check memory alignment, unroll loops?, use old Orbit code?)
x	TLONG use (eg, bitfield); use tfield, set to types[TINT]
	x	undone because switched back to 32-bit long
-	dyn
-	m16 | m32
-	seg: prefix (or suffix)
x	CQO
-	memops
~	structure assign
	-	improve it (load/store)
x	m64 vs m32
x	REX
x	FEMMS (no, it's obsolete)
x	VLONG->QUAD
x	peep
~	MODE 16/32/64 - default operand size, different amode for 16-bit

x	reg num
	0 ax 1 cx 2 dx 3 bx 4 sp 5 bp 6 si 7 di

-	immediate operand values for xmm compare
	0	EQ
	1	LT (or GT with operands exchanged)
	2	LE (or GE with operands exchanged)
	3	unordered
	4	NE
	5	not less than (or not greater than with operands exchanged)
	6	not less than or equal (or not greater than or equal)
	7	ordered
-	when exchanging operands, note that 1st operand is overwritten(!)

abi
x	preserved:
	rbx, rsp, rbp, r12-r15

fixes
-	8c (AFMOVW)
-	8l/span.c (Ycl)
-	/sys/src/libc/port/malloc.c	(ulong)
x	JPC was incorrect in 8l
x	/sys/src/libc/port/profile.c	explicit ref to _subv/_addv, had _ul2v anyhow
-	cast in _ptov (ptov should go)

to do
-	long/ulong constants (OCONST) are truncated, because only 32-bit constants are available in 6a (unless not decimal)
x	MOVL r,s; MOVLQSX s,s -> MOVLQSX r,s
x	see e2.c, e3.c
x	fp1.c
-	DI hack in sugen
x	long as 32 vlong as 64
x	fix to float in both versions
x	ptrbits? addrbits? uptrint?
x	check BSF etc
x	update cc (macbody and -.)
x	build 6pack dist
x	MOVD botch (variously MOVL, MOVQ)
-	../cc/lexbody (ulong)hunk
-	ape setjmp (sigsetjmp)
